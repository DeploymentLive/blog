# First Post of new Blog

Time to get back into the habbit of creating blog posts for my content.

For the past couple of years, I've been working on projects that don't really lend themselves well to blog posting. Mostly internal stuff. 

Now that I'm working for myself at https://deploymentlive.com ( Deployment Live LLC ), I can start posting again.

## Github

In the past I've been using wordpress for my blogs, but this time, I've decided to start posting my work on Github.
I'll be using the https://github.com/skills/github-pages?tab=readme-ov-file template. 

Thanks all...
